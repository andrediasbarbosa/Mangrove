Previous studies constrained the evolution of q$_\{IR\}$ with redshift, finding a mild but significant decline, that is yet to be understood. For the first time, we calibrate q$_\{IR\}$ as a function of textit\{both\} stellar mass (M$_\{star\}$) and redshift, starting from an M$_\{star\}$-selected sample of $>$400,000 star-forming galaxies in the COSMOS field, identified via (NUV-r)/(r-J) colours, at redshifts 0.1$<$z$<$4.5. Within each (M$_\{star\}$,z) bin, we stack the deepest available infrared/sub-mm and radio images. We fit the stacked IR spectral energy distributions with typical star-forming galaxy and IR-AGN templates, and carefully remove radio AGN candidates via a recursive approach. We find that the IRRC evolves primarily with M$_\{star\}$, with more massive galaxies displaying systematically lower q$_\{IR\}$. A secondary, weaker dependence on redshift is also observed. The best-fit analytical expression is the following: q$_\{IR\}$(M$_\{star\}$,z)=(2.646$pm$0.024)$times$(1+z)$^\{(-0.023pm0.008)\}$-(0.148$pm$0.013)$times$($log~M_\{star\}$/M$_\{odot\}$-10). The lower IR/radio ratios seen in more massive galaxies are well described by their higher observed SFR surface densities. Our findings highlight that using radio-synchrotron emission as a proxy for SFR requires novel M$_\{star\}$-dependent recipes, that will enable us to convert detections from future ultra deep radio surveys into accurate SFR measurements down to low-SFR, low-M$_\{star\}$ galaxies.\}, note=\{arXiv: 2010.05510\}, journal=\{Astronomy & Astrophysics\}, author=\{Delvecchio, I. and Daddi, E. and Sargent, M.

As a result, inferring accurate physical parameters requires high-dimensional models which capture or marginalize over this complexity. Here we re-assess inferences of galaxy stellar masses and SFRs using the 14-parameter physical model Prospector-$alpha$ built in the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. We fit the photometry of 58,461 galaxies from the 3D-HST catalogs at $0.5 < z < 2.5$. The resulting stellar masses are $sim0.1-0.3$ dex larger than the fiducial masses while remaining consistent with dynamical constraints. This change is primarily due to the systematically older SFHs inferred with Prospector. The SFRs are $sim0.1-1+$ dex lower than UV+IR SFRs, with the largest offsets caused by emission from \uc0\u8220{}old\uc0\u8221{} ($t>100$ Myr) stars. These new inferences lower the observed cosmic star formation rate density by $sim0.2$ dex and increase the observed stellar mass growth by $sim 0.1$ dex, finally bringing these two quantities into agreement and implying an older, more quiescent Universe than found by previous studies at these redshifts. We corroborate these results by showing that the Prospector-$alpha$ SFHs are both more physically realistic and are much better predictors of the evolution of the stellar mass function. Finally, we highlight examples of observational data which can break degeneracies in the current model; these observations can be incorporated into priors in future models to produce new & more accurate physical parameters.\}, note=\{arXiv: 1812.05608\}, number=\{2\}, journal=\{The Astrophysical Journal\}, author=\{Leja, Joel and Johnson, Benjamin D. and Conroy, Charlie and van Dokkum, Pieter and Speagle, Joshua S. and Brammer, Gabriel and Momcheva, Ivelina and Skelton, Rosalind and Whitaker, Katherine E. and Franx, Marijn and Nelson, Erica J.\}, year=\{2019\}, month=\{Jun\}, pages=\{140\} \}\

Recently, we have proposed that sophisticated panchromatic SED models can resolve this tension, as these methods infer systematically higher masses and lower star formation rates than standard approaches. In a series of papers, we now extend this analysis and present a complete, self-consistent census of galaxy formation over 0.2\uc0\u61600{}<\uc0\u61600{}z\uc0\u61600{}<\uc0\u61600{}3 inferred with the Prospector galaxy SED-\uc0\u64257{}tting code.

We employ a new methodology to infer the mass function from the observed stellar masses: instead of \uc0\u64257{}tting independent mass functions in a series of \uc0\u64257{}xed redshift intervals, we construct a continuity model that directly \uc0\u64257{}ts for the redshift evolution of the mass function. This approach ensures a smooth picture of galaxy assembly and makes use of the full, non-Gaussian uncertainty contours in our stellar mass inferences. The resulting mass function has higher number densities at a \uc0\u64257{}xed stellar mass than almost any other measurement in the literature, largely owing to the older stellar ages inferred by Prospector.

We demonstrate that the chosen method of identifying star-forming galaxies introduces a systematic uncertainty in the inferred normalization and width of the star-forming sequence, peaking for massive galaxies at $sim 0.5$ dex and $sim0.2$ dex respectively. To avoid this systematic, we instead parameterize the density of the full galaxy population in the logM$^*$-logSFR-redshift plane using a flexible neural network known as a normalizing flow. The resulting star-forming sequence has a low-mass slope near unity and a much flatter slope at higher masses, with a normalization $0.2-0.5$ dex lower than typical inferences in the literature. We show this difference is due to the sophistication of the Prospector stellar populations modeling: the nonparametric star formation histories naturally produce higher masses while the combination of individualized metallicity, dust, and star formation history constraints produce lower star formation rates than typical UV+IR formulae. We introduce a simple formalism to understand the difference between SFRs inferred from spectral energy distribution fitting and standard template-based approaches such as UV+IR SFRs. Finally, we demonstrate the inferred star-forming sequence is consistent with predictions from theoretical models of galaxy formation, resolving a long-standing $sim0.2-0.5$ dex offset with observations at $0.5<z<3$.

We measure the MS using mean stacks of 3 GHz radio continuum images to derive average SFRs for $sim$200,000 mass-selected galaxies at $z>0.3$ in the COSMOS field. We describe the MS relation adopting a new model that incorporates a linear relation at low stellar mass (log($M_*$/M$_odot$)$<$10) and a flattening at high stellar mass that becomes more prominent at low redshift ($z<1.5$). We find that the SFR density peaks at $1.5<z<2$ and at each epoch there is a characteristic stellar mass ($M_* = 1 - 4 times 10^\{10\}mathrm\{M\}_odot$) that contributes the most to the overall SFR density. This characteristic mass increases with redshift, at least to $zsim2.5$. We find no significant evidence for variations in the MS relation for galaxies in different environments traced by the galaxy number density at $0.3<z<3$, nor for galaxies in X-ray groups at $zsim0.75$. We confirm that massive bulge-dominated galaxies have lower SFRs than disk-dominated galaxies at a fixed stellar mass at $z<1.2$. As a consequence, the increase in bulge-dominated galaxies in the local star-forming population leads to a flattening of the MS at high stellar masses.

Our large sample allows for a novel approach to investigating the galaxy main sequence that has not been accessible to previous studies. We measure the main sequence in small mass bins in the SFR-M$_\{star\}$ plane without assuming a functional form for the main sequence. With a large sample of galaxies in each mass bin, we isolate star-forming galaxies by locating the transition between the star-forming and green valley populations in the SFR-M$_\{star\}$ plane. This approach eliminates the need for arbitrarily defined fixed cutoffs when isolating the star-forming galaxy population, which often biases measurements of the scatter around the star-forming galaxy main sequence. We find that the main sequence for all galaxies becomes increasingly flat towards present day at the high-mass end, while the star-forming galaxy main sequence does not. We attribute this difference to the increasing fraction of the collective green valley and quiescent galaxy population from $z=3.0$ to $z=1.5$. Additionally, we measure the total scatter around the star-forming galaxy main sequence and find that it is $sim0.5-1.0$ dex with little evolution as a function of mass or redshift.

After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is $sim 0.2$ dex and remains constant over cosmic time.
